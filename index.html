      <p id="text1">Have you ever felt that you cannot express yourself? Because I have done... When the words leave me I turn to music.<br>
 Music has been always with me, since I was born in a family full of musicians. My life can be divided into three main parts: the innocent childhood singing, then trying out myself as an actress and later on I became a passionate songwriter and teacher. Even though, I have tried out myself in different fields before fate pulled me back to music. Nowadays I am a full-time mother of a beautiful baby girl. <br>
 My biggest music achievement by now is my latest album, Novelle, which we released together with my band in the last year. By its lyrics I want to touch people’s souls and show how complex a person could be on the inside. Whatever you are going through, you are not alone.

      <p  id="text2"> Beside being a mother now, I am a music teacher in a conservatory. My intention is to provide my baby girl a stable financial background, therefore when she will go to kindergarten, I will return back as a full-time teacher.
 I am passionate in teaching, since during my classes I can meet many talented people. They are inspiring me with their personal background, music style and personality. From time to time, I can collaborate with them in order to create another amazing and meaningful song. As a teacher, it is always a pleasure to see how my students evolve and how they shine when they can show their talent.</p>

      <p id="text3"> For some musician it can be hard to present themselves. Even though they are ingenious and talented, they do not have an extrovert personality. For me, it has never been a problem.
 When someone asks me “Why acting?” I explain them that, for me, it comes naturally from inside. It gives me sparks and that feeling that I am doing it right, because this is my place. By being an actress beside being a musician, I can complete my songs and give more to my audience. </p>

    <p id="text4"> Nowadays, the most essential part of my artist side is composing songs and writing their lyrics. I have always been that type of person who communicates with music. With my lyrics, I would like to tell a whole story based on my real life experiences. All of my songs has a message to tell.
 It is a special feeling when I ask someone about my song and he or she tells a completely new interpretation of the message. From these feedbacks, I know that I succeeded in touching the people’s souls.  </p>

    <p id="text5"> Sometimes people can take the life as it would be granted. Instead of evaluating life as if it would be a gift, they consider it as a long-term pain. From time to time we can meet these people or they can be our family members as well. Due to personal reasons, they can also start drinking. We still love them, even though they do not let us to help them. The only thing we can give them is love. Although, this love is full of sorrow. </p>
